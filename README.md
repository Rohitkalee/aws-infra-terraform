# üöÄ Terraform-Aws Infra Project

---

## üìã **Overview**

This project automates the deployment of a **secure** and **scalable** cloud infrastructure on **AWS** using **Terraform**. The setup includes key AWS components to ensure high availability, security, and efficiency:

- **VPC** with public and private subnets  
- **EC2 instances** for app servers  
- **NAT Gateway** for secure internet access  
- **Nginx reverse proxy** for traffic routing  
- **Load Balancer** for fault tolerance  
- **S3 & DynamoDB** for Terraform state management

## üß© **Architecture Components**

| Component                    | Description                                                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPC**                      | Isolated AWS network environment.                                      |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)**   | Connects VPC to the internet; enables public subnet connectivity.      |
| **Public Subnets**           | Host internet-facing resources (e.g., Bastion Host).                   |
| **Private Subnets**          | Host internal resources like application servers.                      |
| **Route Tables**             | Routes traffic appropriately (public ‚Üí IGW, private ‚Üí NAT Gateway).    |
| **NAT Gateway**              | Allows private subnet instances outbound internet access securely.     | 
| **Elastic IP**               | Static IP assigned to NAT Gateway for stable connectivity.             |
| **Security Groups**          | Virtual firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic.                |
| **Nginx Instances**          | Reverse proxy servers located in public subnets.                       |
| **Apache Backend Instances** | Web servers located in private subnets.                                |
| **Load Balancer**            | Distributes incoming traffic for fault tolerance and high availability.|

## üõ†Ô∏è **Getting Started**

1. **Install Terraform:**  
   Download from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

2. **Configure AWS Credentials:**  
   Setup AWS CLI credentials on your machine (`aws configure`).

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
   - Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.

4. **Plan the Deployment:**
   - Execute `terraform plan` to preview the infrastructure changes.

5. **Apply the Deployment:**
   - Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure on AWS.
